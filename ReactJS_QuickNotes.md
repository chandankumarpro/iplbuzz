# Development Practices for ReactJS

- [Variable Declarations](#variable-declarations)
- [Function Declarations](#function-declarations)

## Variable Declarations

1. Always use **`const`** for values that do not need to be reassigned.  
2. **`const`** values can be **mutated** if they are objects or arrays.  
3. Use **`let`** if the variable is block-scoped and needs to be reassigned e.g. for loop.  
4. Avoid using **`var`** â€” it gets **hoisted**, which can lead to bugs.
5. Use **`const`** in props destructuring:

    ```js
    const { name, age } = props;
    ```

6. Use **`const`** in state variables.

    ```js
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    ```

## Function Declarations

### Arrow functions

1. For react component declaration prefer **Arrow function** (ES6 syntax).
2. If you are inside react component prefer to use **Arrow functions**, this will avoid re-rendering.
3. Avoid inline anonymous function inside JSX for better performamnce.
4. When passing functions to memoized or child components use **Arrow functions with useCallback** to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

    ```js
    const handleClick = useCallback(() => {}, []);
    ```

5. Function name should be meaningful or descriptive.
6. Avoid define functions inside useEffect.

### Named functions

1. Named functions have hoisting behavior.
2. We can use Named function in helper / reuadsable function outside component.
3. **`this`** binding works only in named functions, named functions get thier own **`this`**.
